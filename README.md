# Pong Game in Python (Turtle Module)

This is a simple Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. It is part of the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Bootcamp" course by Angela Yu on Udemy.

## Features
- Two-player mode (Player 1 and Player 2).
- Paddle movement controlled by keyboard.
- Ball movement and bouncing off walls.
- Scoring system for both players.
- Simple and interactive UI.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Turtle Graphics

## Installation
To play the game, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You also need the `turtle` module, which comes pre-installed with most Python installations.

### Steps to run the game:

1. **Clone the Repository** (optional):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-pong.git
    cd python-pong
    ```

2. **Install Python**:
   If you haven't already installed Python, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Run the Game**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the Python script is saved. Then, run:
    ```bash
    main.py
    ```

## How to Play
- **Player 1** (left side): Use the `W` key to move up and the `S` key to move down.
- **Player 2** (right side): Use the `Up Arrow` key to move up and the `Down Arrow` key to move down.
- The ball will bounce off the top and bottom walls, and you need to make sure it doesn't pass your paddle. If it does, the other player scores a point.

## Controls:
- **Player 1**: `W` to move up, `S` to move down
- **Player 2**: `Up Arrow` to move up, `Down Arrow` to move down

## Scoring System
- Each time the ball passes a playerâ€™s paddle, the opponent earns one point.
